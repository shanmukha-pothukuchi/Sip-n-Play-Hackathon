          Founder, Jonathan Li, shares a passion for board games, boba, and
          delicious food, so he combined them all to become Sip & Play, Park
          Slopeâ€™s first board game cafe. It is a straightforward concept, come
          in with your friends and family to play any board game from our
          library of 300+ games! We hope when you visit, you also enjoy our
          coffee, espresso, boba, sandwiches, and snacks!
